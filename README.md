## Lab №1. Statistical color correction.

This is my university lab work on computer graphics. It is dedicated to statistical light correction. The task was to write a program that would take 2 images and overlay the color of one on top of the other.

Before that, I didn’t write under the WPF at all, so I don’t know how competently it was possible to set up the architecture / scatter files, so I did it on a whim.

I would be glad if some of you will find these developments useful. YES, it was possible to do it easier with matrix multiplication (it was possible to multiply hardcoded), but I used the "Math.Net" library for this. There seems to be no frank nightmare in the code, I hope everything will be clear, if you can send a PR with refactoring - great!

Even if you don't understand C#, the translation math should be simple and rewritten for any language. <b>Coefficients and translation algorithms are correct.
